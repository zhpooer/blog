# Global Styles #

In particular, the following default styles give special treatment
to typography and links:
* margin has been removed from the body, and content will snug up to the edges of
the browser window.
* background-color: white; is applied to the body.
* Bootstrap is using the @baseFontFamily, @baseFontSize, and @baseLineHeight
attributes as our typographic base.
*  Bootstrap sets the global link color via @linkColor and applies link underlines only
on :hover.

Remember, if you donâ€™t like the colors or want to change a default, this
can be done by changing the globals in any of the .less files. To do this,
update the scaffolding.less file or overwrite colors in your own stylesheet.

# Default Grid System #

The default Bootstrap grid system utilizes 12 columns, making for a
940px-wide container without responsive features enabled. 

With the responsive CSS file added, the grid adapts to be 724px or
1170px wide, depending on your viewport.

Below 767px viewports, such as the ones on tablets and smaller devices, the columns
become fluid and stack vertically. At the default width, each column is 60 pixels wide
and offset 20 pixels to the left.

## Basic Grid HTML ##

To create a simple layout, create a container with a `<div>` that has a class of
`.row` and add the appropriate amount of `.span*` columns.
Since we have a 12-column grid, we just need the amount of .span* columns to equal 12.

~~~~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">...</div>
  <div class="span4">...</div>
</div>
~~~~~~

## Offsetting Columns ##

You can move columns to the right using the `.offset*` class.
Each class moves the span over that width.

~~~~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="span2">...</div>
  <div class="span7 offset2">...</div>
</div>
~~~~~~

## Nesting Columns ##

To nest your content with the default grid, inside of a `.span*`, simply add a
new `.row` with enough `.span*` that it equals the number of spans of the parent container.

~~~~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="span9">
    Level 1 of column
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span6">Level 2</div>
      <div class="span3">Level 2</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
~~~~~~

# Fluid Grid System #

The fluid grid system uses percentages instead of pixels for column widths.
It has the same responsive capabilities as our fixed grid system,
ensuring proper proportions for key screen resolutions and devices.
~~~~~~
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span4">...</div>
  <div class="span8">...</div>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span4">...</div>
  <div class="span4 offset2">...</div>
</div>
~~~~~~

Nesting a fluid grid is a little different.
Since we are using percentages, each `.row` resets the column count to 12.

For example, if you were inside a `.span8`, instead of
two `.span4` elements to divide the content in half, you would use two `.span6` divs

~~~~~~
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span8">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span6">...</div>
      <div class="span6">...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
~~~~~~

# Container Layouts #

To add a fixed-width, centered layout to your page, simply wrap the content in
`<div class="container">...</div>`.
If you would like to use a fluid layout but want to wrap
everything in a container, use the following: `<div class="container-fluid">...</div>`.

Using a fluid layout is great when you are building applications, administration
screens, and other related projects.

# Responsive Design #
To turn on the responsive features of Bootstrap, you need to
add a `<meta>` tag to the `<head>` of your web page.
~~~~~~
<head>
  <title>My amazing Bootstrap site!</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link href="/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="/css/bootstrap-responsive.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
~~~~~~

Responsive design is a method for taking all of the existing content that is on the page
and optimizing it for the device that is viewing it.

To target these different widths, Bootstrap uses CSS media queries to measure
the width of the browser viewport
and then, using conditionals, changes which parts of the stylesheets are loaded. 

At the core, Bootstrap supports five different layouts, each relying on CSS media queries.

| Label | Layout width | Column width | Gutter width |
|-----|
| Large display | 1200px and up | 70px | 30px |
| Default | 980px and up |60px | 20px |
| Portrait tablets | 768px and up | 42px | 20px |
| Phones to tablets |  767px and below |  Fluid columns, no fixed widths |
| Phones | 480px and below |  Fluid columns, no fixed widths |

To add custom CSS based on the media query, you can either include all rules in one
CSS file via the media queries below, or use entirely different CSS files:

~~~~~~
/* Large desktop */
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

/* Portrait tablet to landscape and desktop */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px) { ... }

/* Landscape phone to portrait tablet */
@media (max-width: 767px) { ... }

/* Landscape phones and down */
@media (max-width: 480px) { ... }
~~~~~~
If you are using LESS to compile the CSS, you can have
them all processed into one file:
~~~~~~
<link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 1200px)" href="large.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px)"
      href="tablet.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 767px)" href="tablet.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 480px)" href="phone.css" />
~~~~~~

## Helper classes ##

Bootstrap also includes a handful of helper classes for
doing responsive development.

| Class | Phones |  Tablets  | Desktops |
|------|
| .visible-phone | Visible | Hidden |  Hidden |
| .visible-tablet | Hidden |  Visible | Hidden |
| .visible-desktop| Hidden | Hidden |  Visible |
| .hidden-phone | Hidden | Visible | Visible |
| .hidden-tablet | Visible | Hidden | Visible |
| .hidden-desktop | Visible | Visible | Hidden |
